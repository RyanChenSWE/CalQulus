1. Generate math problems / get the appropriate dataset
- https://mathy.ai/

- Mathpix to convert from image -> Latex
- latex -> to solution
	- Trying to parse the LaTeX expression using Regex would be an absolute nightmare. When we look at a LaTeX expression, we don't actually think about these concepts in terms of the literal characters that make them up.
like $\int x^2dx$
- OpenAI solution with grade-school-math (comprehension problem)

Tool to help teachers.
- Special cases: Partial fractions, complex number, RREF for linear algebra, complex numbers, complex logic,  Baye's Rules,  simplify, 

Frontend / Backend
- Get the VR visualization, display a series of text as the answer to the problem. (Don't do mobile app because that has already been done, but rather do VR/AR).

For derives and integrals, you can plot the function.

Rather, we think at a more abstract level in terms of X.
